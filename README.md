# Numerical-Methods-A-Two-dimensional-Transient-Conduction-Problem
Implementation of a numerical methods Matlab code with a line-by-line solver (Gauss-Seidel and TDMA).

Focus of study: thermal transient analysis of a tetramaterialcross section bar.

Project performed as an additional activity of the subject "Gas dynamics and heat and mass transfer", part of the BSc Aerospace Engineering

An example of the resulting temperature maps are:
